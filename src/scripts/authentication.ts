/*
 * authentication.ts - The core authentication manager of the application.
 *
 * This file is responsible for managing user authentication, including validation, sign-in, and sign-up functionality.
 * While there were **much simpler** ways to implement this, the complexity and additional logic were purely for fun.
 * The task given to us didnâ€™t require this level of depth.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Validates users based on authentication tokens stored in cookies.
 * - Implements a custom **UUID generator** (because why use built-in solutions when you can learn by doing your own?).
 * - Uses a *hashing* function to demonstrate password security (even if the salt handling is... questionable).
 * - Supports automatic token expiration, keeping users logged in only for a set duration.
 * - Includes a toggle function to switch between login and sign-up modes dynamically.
 * - Handles user authentication, sign-up, and sign-out with custom error messages.
 *
 * This file acts as the **identity manager** of the application, ensuring that users can sign in, sign out, and stay logged in without needing to re-authenticate constantly.
 * Itâ€™s unnecessarily long and complex for the task at hand, but it was a fun exercise in learning and implementing various security concepts.
 *
